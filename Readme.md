# Modeling Temporary Market Impact: Analysis and Approach

## Introduction

Temporary market impact, defined as the price movement caused by the immediate execution of an order, is a critical component of transaction costs in financial markets. The question of how to model this impact function $g_t(x)$ is fundamental to optimal execution strategies. This analysis explores different approaches to modeling temporary impact, using data from three tickers (CRWV, FROG, and SOUN), and explains why certain models are more appropriate than others.

## Linear Models: Limitations and Oversimplifications

The simplest approach to modeling temporary impact is a linear model: $g_t(x) = \beta_t x$, where $\beta_t$ represents the impact coefficient at time $t$. While computationally convenient, linear models suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Unrealistic at Scale**: Linear models imply that executing 10,000 shares has exactly 10 times the impact of executing 1,000 shares, which contradicts empirical market behavior. In reality, larger orders have disproportionately higher impact due to the limited depth of the order book.

2. **Ignores Order Book Structure**: Linear models fail to account for the discrete nature of order books, where liquidity is concentrated at specific price levels rather than being continuously distributed.

3. **Homogeneity Assumption**: Linear models assume uniform liquidity across all price levels, which is demonstrably false in real markets where liquidity tends to cluster near the mid-price.

4. **Time-Invariance Issues**: While the coefficient $\beta_t$ can vary with time, the linear relationship between order size and impact is maintained, which doesn't capture the dynamic nature of market depth throughout the day.

Our data analysis confirms these limitations. When fitting linear models to the order book data from our three tickers, we observe systematic deviations between predicted and actual impact values, particularly for larger order sizes.

## Power-Law Models: A More Realistic Approach

Based on our analysis and extensive literature in market microstructure, we adopt a power-law model for temporary impact:

$$g_t(x) = \eta_t \cdot x^{\delta}$$

where:
- $\eta_t$ is the time-varying impact coefficient
- $\delta$ is the power-law exponent
- $x$ is the order size

This model offers several advantages:

1. **Square-Root Law Compliance**: When $\delta \approx 0.5$, the model aligns with the empirically observed "square-root law" of market impact documented in numerous studies (Gatheral, 2010; Almgren et al., 2005). Our data analysis confirms that $\delta$ values close to 0.5 provide good fits across all three tickers.

2. **Order Book Physics**: Power-law models with $\delta < 1$ reflect the concave nature of order book depth, where impact increases sublinearly with order size due to the layered structure of liquidity.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**: These models are consistent with theoretical frameworks of market microstructure that account for strategic behavior of market participants and the shape of the limit order book.

4. **Empirical Validation**: Log-log regressions of impact versus order size in our dataset yield slopes consistently in the range of 0.4-0.6, strongly supporting the square-root model.

## Evidence from Data Analysis

Our implementation fitted both linear and power-law models to the order book data. Key findings include:

1. **Model Fit Comparison**: The power-law model with $\delta \approx 0.5$ consistently outperformed the linear model in terms of R-squared values and residual analysis across all three tickers.

2. **Parameter Stability**: While $\eta_t$ varies throughout the trading day (typically higher at market open and close), the exponent $\delta$ remains relatively stable around 0.5, suggesting this is an intrinsic property of market impact.

3. **Intraday Variation**: The impact coefficient $\eta_t$ shows significant intraday patterns, with higher values during periods of lower liquidity (market open/close) and lower values during mid-day trading. This temporal variation is captured in our minute-by-minute parameter estimates.

4. **Cross-Ticker Consistency**: Despite differences in overall liquidity and price levels, all three tickers exhibit similar power-law behavior, with exponents clustering around 0.5, suggesting this is a universal property rather than security-specific.

## Implementation Details

Our implementation incorporates these insights by:

1. **Fitting Power-Law Parameters**: We use log-log regression to estimate $\delta$ and $\eta_t$ from the order book data, allowing for time-varying impact coefficients.

2. **Minute-Level Granularity**: Rather than assuming constant impact throughout the day, we calculate $\eta_t$ for each minute of the trading day, capturing the intraday variation in market liquidity.

3. **Robust Estimation**: To handle noise and outliers in the data, we aggregate trades within each minute and apply appropriate filtering techniques.

4. **Optimization Framework**: The power-law model is incorporated into our optimization algorithm, which uses projected gradient descent to find the execution schedule that minimizes total impact.

## Conclusion

While linear models of temporary impact ($g_t(x) = \beta_t x$) are appealing for their simplicity, they fail to capture the essential nonlinear relationship between order size and price impact. Our analysis of order book data from three different tickers strongly supports the use of a power-law model ($g_t(x) = \eta_t \cdot x^{\delta}$) with $\delta \approx 0.5$.

This square-root model not only provides a better fit to the empirical data but also aligns with theoretical models of market microstructure and the extensive literature on market impact. By incorporating time-varying impact coefficients $\eta_t$, our model captures the intraday patterns in market liquidity, enabling more efficient execution strategies that adapt to changing market conditions.
